# Synonym Finder

Synonym Finder is a web-based application that helps you find context-aware synonyms for words in an English text. It dynamically suggests alternatives with Japanese translations and allows for one-click replacement, powered by the Google Gemini API. It also includes a history panel and a flashcard quiz feature to enhance your learning experience.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Context-Aware Synonym Generation**: Utilizes the Gemini API to provide high-quality synonyms that match the word's meaning in the sentence (e.g., distinguishing between "book" as a noun and "book" as a verb).
- **One-Click Word Replacement**: Simply click on a suggestion to replace the original word in the text.
- **Japanese Translations**: Displays Japanese translations for both the original words and the synonym candidates.
- **Interactive UI**:
    - A three-panel layout showing History, Text Input, and Synonym Candidates.
    - Hovering over a suggestion on the right highlights the corresponding word on the left.
    - Clicking a replaceable word in the text scrolls to its suggestion card.
- **Collapsible History Panel**:
    - Automatically saves your processed texts, grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, etc.).
    - The panel stays collapsed on the left and expands on hover for a clean workspace.
    - Clicking a history item restores the text and the original synonym analysis.
- **Bookmark & Flashcard System**:
    - Bookmark interesting words and their synonyms for later review.
    - Launch a flashcard quiz from your bookmarked words.
    - Flip cards to test your knowledge and delete words you've mastered.
